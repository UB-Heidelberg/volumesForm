**volumesForm Plugin**

This plugin extends the press settings (series and categories) in OMP by adding the type "volume".

Compatible with OMP 3.3.0

Upon installation the plugin will:
* create two new database tables: volumes and volume_settings
* add a new tab under Press settings which lets you add new volumes
* add a select-menu to the submission form at step1 and the title-abstract-tab (optionally to the quicksubmit form...)
* show volumes on the catalog page in the frontend
